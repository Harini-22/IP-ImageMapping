    A chicken curry is the ultimate crowd pleaser and an absolute must-have on an Indian dinner party menu.

    India boasts of various flavours of chicken curries from different regions. The great Indian'kari', 
    which stems from the word for sauce in Tamil, is known to have originated sometime during the ancient Indus civilization. 
    Since then it has travelled beyond boundaries and created many fans across the globe. And Britain's love affair with 'curry' is no 
    secret - chicken tikka masala is the most popular restaurant meal in England.</p><hr>
