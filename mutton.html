<p style="font-size: 19px;">Among the different kinds of meat dishes across India, mutton preparations have always garnered a 
    bigger fan following. The red meat when cooked carefully results in a buttery and tender treat, the flavour of which blends 
    delightfully well with the myriad spices that go into its preparation. No wonder then it's regarded as a prime delicacy, and 
    reserved for special occasions, festivals and get-togethers. In some cultures, it is even taken as an offense if one is
     invited for a meal and not served
     a mutton curry regardless of the other dishes laid out on the table.</p><hr>

<h2>1.NALLI NIHARI</h2>

<p style="font-size: 19px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TNo Eid celebration is 
    ever complete without indulging in a plate of Nalli Nihari with Khameeri Roti. The buttery gravy with delicate pieces of 
    mutton falling off the bone is supposed to be a breakfast treat. As per expert chefs, the nihari is perfect when the meat cooks 
    so much so that it blends with the gravy, acquiring almost the same texture. The slow-cooked dish (traditionally cooked overnight) 
    uses a handful of spices like kewda water, screw pine, cardamom, mace and others,
     and is usually garnished with ginger julienne, green chillies and coriander leaves.

<h2>2.KOSHA MANGSHO</h2>

<p style="font-size: 19px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few things that can beat the pleasure of relishing a plate of piping hot luchis with Kosha Mangsho, the Bengali mutton curry. Come Sunday, and most Bengali households prepare mutton curry for lunch, taking all their time to pound the spice mix and cook the meat till tender. Don't miss the addition of potatoes in the meat curry. Soaked with the lip-smacking flavours of the curry, they too are immensely satisfying to team with rice or luchi. Kosha Mangsho requires a range of spices to acquire its deep red colour, but it 
    isn't outrageously spicy. Cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and bay leaves are a must.

<h2>3.ANDHRA GANGURA MAMSAM</h2>

<p style="font-size: 19px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andhra cuisine is known for 
    its love for spices, particularly chillies, but not all dishes are fiery hot. The Andhra-style mutton curry called mamsam is 
    a delectable curry which is made with a range of local ingredients in the households of Andhra. Gongura, belonging to the Hibiscus
     family, comes in two varieties - green and red stemmed. These leaves lend a distinctive flavour to the
     mutton curry, when it is slow-cooked in a spicy gravy.
